# Solana Volume Maker - Updates

This document outlines the recent enhancements made to the Solana Volume Maker to improve its reliability, efficiency, and RPC usage optimization.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. RPC Optimization

- **Alternative RPC System**: Implemented a round-robin selection of alternative RPCs to distribute load and reduce costs
- **RPC Failover**: Added intelligent fallback mechanisms that automatically switch to available RPCs when the primary one fails
- **Default RPC Configuration**: Added sensible defaults for alternative RPCs when none are provided

```python
def _get_alt_rpc_client(self):
    """
    Returns an alternative RPC client for use in confirmations, to optimize RPC usage.
    This method implements a round-robin selection of alternative RPCs to distribute load
    and reduce costs on main RPC.
    """
    # Implementation details
```

### 2. Asynchronous Transaction Confirmation

- **Improved Confirmation Process**: Enhanced the asynchronous confirmation system to track transaction statuses without blocking the main process
- **RPC Usage Optimization**: Uses cheaper alternative RPCs for confirmations while reserving the premium RPC for transaction creation and sending
- **Smart Retry Logic**: Added exponential backoff and intelligent retry mechanisms when confirmations take longer than expected

```python
async def _async_confirm_transaction(self, wallet_index, txn_sig, max_retries=5, retry_delay=1, amount=0.00001):
    """
    Asynchronously confirm a transaction using alternative RPCs to minimize cost
    """
    # Implementation details
```

### 3. Batch Mode Improvements

- **Parallel Transaction Processing**: Updated batch mode to process transactions in parallel for faster throughput
- **Better Feedback**: Added detailed status updates during transaction processing
- **Automatic Recovery**: Implemented intelligent recovery of failed transactions
- **Improved Error Handling**: Enhanced error detection and handling for more reliable operation

### 4. Status Monitoring

- **Detailed Status Reporting**: Enhanced confirmation status reporting with success rates and pending transaction details
- **RPC Usage Statistics**: Added tracking of RPC usage to identify optimization opportunities

```python
def get_confirmation_status(self):
    """
    Get the status of pending confirmations and statistics on RPC usage optimization.
    """
    # Implementation details showing success rates, pending transactions, etc.
```

## Usage

These enhancements are automatically applied when using the Solana Volume Maker. No changes to the command-line arguments or configuration are required.

For optimal performance:

1. Configure multiple alternative RPCs in your config.json
2. Use batch mode for efficient transaction processing
3. Monitor the logs for transaction status and RPC performance

## Configuration Example

To take full advantage of the RPC optimization, configure alternative RPCs in your config.json:

```json
{
  "chains": {
    "solana": {
      "alternative_rpcs": [
        "https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com",
        "https://solana-api.projectserum.com",
        "https://rpc.ankr.com/solana"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Safety and Best Practices

1. Always check the logs for any transaction failures
2. Use batch mode with a small number of wallets first to verify everything works as expected
3. Keep your main wallet with sufficient funds for the operations you plan to perform
4. Backup your wallet private keys before starting any operations
