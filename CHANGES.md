# Solana Volume Maker Enhancements

The following changes have been implemented to optimize the Solana Volume Maker's performance and RPC usage:

## Core Functionality Improvements

1. Added `_get_alt_rpc_client` method for handling alternative RPCs in a round-robin fashion
   - Reduces costs by using cheaper RPCs for confirmations
   - Improves reliability with automatic failover between RPCs
   
2. Enhanced `_async_confirm_transaction` to use alternative RPCs for transaction confirmations
   - Tracks pending confirmations asynchronously
   - Allows batch operations to continue without waiting for confirmations
   - Implements exponential backoff for retries

3. Updated `batch_mode` to provide better feedback and handle confirmations more efficiently
   - Parallel processing of transactions
   - Detailed status reporting during batch operations
   - Improved recovery of failed transactions

4. Improved `confirm_txn` in common_utils.py to support alternative RPCs
   - Automatically tries different RPCs when confirmation fails
   - Tracks which RPCs are working and which are failing

5. Added default alternative RPCs when none are configured
   - Ensures system can always fall back to public RPCs
   - Provides a smooth experience even without explicit configuration

6. Enhanced priority fee system with automatic scaling
   - Progressively increases fees on retries (up to 425% for 5th retry)
   - Specifically targets compute budget errors with higher increases
   - Prevents excessive fees with maximum caps

## Logging and Monitoring Improvements

1. Added detailed logging for transaction confirmations
   - Shows which RPCs are being used for each attempt
   - Reports confirmation status with confirmations count
   - Logs each retry with specific error information

2. Enhanced status reporting in `get_confirmation_status`
   - Provides success rates and detailed statistics
   - Reports on pending transactions with elapsed time
   - Shows RPC usage patterns and optimization status

3. Improved batch mode logging
   - Shows transaction progress in real-time
   - Reports elapsed and remaining time during confirmations
   - Provides clear success/failure statistics

4. Added extensive logging for priority fee increases
   - Shows percentage increases for each retry
   - Logs before/after fee values
   - Reports specific error conditions triggering increases

## Results

These changes significantly improve the Solana Volume Maker in several ways:

1. **Cost Reduction**: Uses cheaper RPCs for confirmation operations while only using premium RPCs for transaction sending
2. **Improved Reliability**: Automatically recovers from failures and retries with appropriate priority fee increases
3. **Better Visibility**: Provides detailed logging and status reporting throughout the process
4. **Optimized Performance**: Handles transactions in parallel and continues operations without waiting for confirmations

The improvements also ensure that all types of failures are properly tracked and handled:
- Failed transactions (returned errors)
- Transactions that exceed max retries
- Confirmation failures

Wallets with failed transactions are automatically saved for recovery, especially those that failed despite using increased priority fees.
