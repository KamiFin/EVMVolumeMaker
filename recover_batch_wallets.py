Batch Wallet Recovery Script

This script is used to recover funds from batch wallets if the program
was interrupted during batch mode operation.

Usage:
    python recover_batch_wallets.py [--use-multisig] [--swap-amount AMOUNT] [--file FILE]

Options:
    --use-multisig     Use multi-signature buy/sell method for recovery (recommended)
    --swap-amount      Specific amount of SOL to use for swap (default: 0.00001)
    --file             Recovery file to use. Options:
                       'batch' - Use batch_wallets_recovery.json (default)
                       'failed' - Use failed_batch_wallets.json

Recovery Files:
    - wallet_recovery/batch_wallets_recovery.json: Contains wallets from the last batch mode run
    - wallet_recovery/failed_batch_wallets.json: Contains all batch wallets that have failed

Recovery Methods:
    1. Standard Recovery:
       - Each batch wallet sells tokens individually
       - Proceeds are transferred back to main wallet
       - May not succeed if there are issues with token balances or permissions
       
    2. Multi-Signature Recovery (Recommended):
       - Uses advanced multi-signature mechanism mimicking professional trading ops
       - Main wallet creates transactions, batch wallets appear as initiators
       - More effective at recovering tokens and emptying batch wallets
       - Works even in cases where standard recovery fails
